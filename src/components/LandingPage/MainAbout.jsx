          Meetro was born out of a simple problem we were always missing events
          or finding out too late. Between the noise on social media and the
          stress of planning, it just felt harder to connect in real life.

          Meetro helps you create, share, and manage private events
          effortlessly, while also making it fun to discover things happening
          around you. Whether it’s a chill hangout with friends or a community
          event, we’re here to make meeting up easy, intentional, and
          stress-free.
